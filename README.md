# Ableton_Max_OSC

Here I put all the necessary files that 
you need to get started if you are curious, or just bored like me. 
Open the Live set, load the max device in any track and then run Open Stage Control. 
When you open the Live set there are only two tracks with only the first clips being loaded. 
After adding the Max device you can open it in Max and see how things are done. For this 
I prepared the file to only control the first clip of the first track. It is also 
very straightforward to add or modify the device if you wich to do so. The next step is 
to download (OpenStageControl)[https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/] and set the send and 
recieve ports as the ones in the Max device. After running the Open Stage Control you 
should be able to load the "json" file in the repository with the stop, play and clip progress knob 
that corresponds to the first clip in the frist track.
